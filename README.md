## Hey there
This is my public GitHub repository profile. Repo's here are only the ones I make in my freetime.
Material from work will remain private. Most aren't on GitHub anyways.

This is currently pretty expansive, I will move most of it to my website once I've finished making that. For now info will reside here.

## Music
Some of my favourites I guess
